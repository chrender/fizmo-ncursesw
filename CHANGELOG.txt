   Version 0.7.2
 + 0.7.2 was finished at about (?).
 - Fixed missing $(DESTDIR) variable -- should already have been present
   since version 0.7.1.

   Version 0.7.1
 + 0.7.1 was finished at about Sun Nov 6 22:44:17 CET 2011.
 - Fixed missing "override" statments for CFLAGS in Makefiles.
 - Fixed $(DESTDIR) evaluation in config.[default|macports].mk.
 - Changed manpage install dir from "man" to "share/man".
 - Adapted Makefiles and configuration to use standard GNU Makefile variables
   instead of INSTALL_PATH and FIZMO_BIN_DIR.
 - Respect LD_FLAGS for linking.

   Version 0.7.0
 + 0.7.0 was finished at about Sun Sep 18 08:41:18 CEST 2011.
 + The "fizmo-ncursesw" interface has been re-implemented for version 0.7. It
   now makes use of libcellif for output. It uses libfizmo's new word
   hyphenation and implements better X11-output through libdrilbo.
 - X11 frontispiece display is now by default in a separate window, which,
   contrary to the older implementation that simply invoked a XCopyArea
   directly into the terminal's X window, should work reliably. For
   terminals which by chance support it, the old behaviour is still
   available by using the "display-x11-inline-image" config option. The
   inline display has been changed to no longer write directly into the
   terminal window, but instead to use a subwindow instead.
 - Adapted to version 0.7 locale system and the new build process.

   Version 0.6.9
 + 0.6.9 was finished at about Sun Apr 24 22:26:18 CEST 2011.
 - Added NCURSESW_INCLUDE_FROM_W_DIRNAME to configs to allow usage of
   Apple's ncurses implementation, added GDKPIXBUF_INC_DIR configuration
   variable.

   Version 0.6.4
 + 0.6.4 was finished at about Sun May 24 13:45:31 CEST 2009.
 + Bugfix release: Definitely recommend for read_char fix.
 - Fixed interface to supply default colors in case ncurses' "pair_content"
   returned invalid colors (thanks to Samuel Verschelde).
 - Input from read_char is no longer re-echoed to the screen (thanks to
   Samnuel Verschelde).

   Version 0.6.0
 + 0.6.0 was finished at about Wed Mar 25 21:47:06 CET 2009.
 + This marks the point for the first public beta release.
 - Implemented conversion of font 3 (charachter font) to unicode. This
   appears to make Beyond Zork's map appear at least readable.
 - Implemented recording and replaying of timed input.
 - The filename input for save and restore may now be cancelled using the
   escape key.
 - Pressing arrow up/down during filename input no longer displays the
   command history.
 - Implemented wordwrapper / ncursesw margins.
 - Implemented "no-update" command line flag and config option to avoid
   long startup scan times (for example on slow notebook drivers with many
   story files).
 - Implemented "--search" and "--recursively-search" command line invocations.
 - Fixed bug in scrollback parapgraph position cache.
 - Fixed scroll-down display for scrolling to bottom.
 - Fixed crash that occured when a read-instruction was recursively called
   from a timed input verification-routine.
 - Fixed display error on refresh of preloaded input from history.
 - Implemented forced predictable mode (ignores seeding random generator).
 - Many, many other minor fixes and extensions.

   Version 0.5.3
 + 0.5.3 was finished at about Wed Mar 11 21:34:59 CET 2009.
 - Re-wrote Makefile system. Releveant module defaults are now kept in
   separate .mk-files.
 - Added support for extra-blorb files (these are specified on the command
   line directly after the story file name).
 - Added "-Wextra" flag to CFLAGS and cleaned up new warnings caused by
   the new flag.
 - Many minor fixes (option system, running X11-enabled fizmo in text-only
   console, etc).

   Version 0.5.2
 + 0.5.2 was finished at about Sat Jan 17 17:07:07 CET 2009.
 - Implemented story selection menu in ncursesw interface.
 - Implemented parsing of rc file.
 - Added bold-for-bright-foreground and blink-for-bright-background terminal
   options.
 - Implemented dont-use-color and force-color option.
 - Fixed interface for > 121 colors.
 - Added "help" command.
 - Implemented text paragraph position cache to speed up scrollback for
   large amounts of text (not elegant, but works).
 - Implemened "force-quetzal-umem" config option from the command line.
 - Added manpage.
 - Implemented basic blorb support (meaning that blorb files are detected,
   information about pictures and sound is parsed and the first found "ZCOD"
   chunk is executed).
 - Stories may now be started from the command line using their "real name"
   in case they are stored in the story-list. Example: "fizmo sorcerer".
 - Many, many small fixes (scrollback, winch-redisplay, negative score,
   undo, crash on large scrollbacks, etc).

   Version 0.5.1
 + 0.5.1 was finished at about Di 4 Nov 2008 21:48:29 CET.
 - Fixed scrollback and i18n-exit-translation.
 - Fixed libfizmo to also use setitimer/sigaction (makes fizmo work better
   on linux).
 - Implemented foreground/background color command line parameters for
   ncursesw interface.
 - Fixed get-cursor-[column|row] for ncursesw (makes PRINT_TABLE and
   Sherlock work).
 - Implemented restore from the command line: In case a quetzal-savegame
   containing the non-standard-chunk "FILE" is given on the command line,
   fizmo will try to restore the savegame using the story filename stored
   in this chunk.

   Version 0.5.0
 + 0.5.0 was finished at about Do 30 Okt 2008 11:42:27 CET.
 + This version is now definitely usable to play all non-v6 games. Did
   extensive testing using Borderzone, "LostPig.z8", "Zokoban.z5", "crashme.z5",
  "etude.z5", "paint.z5", "random.z5", "reverzi.z5" and "unicode.z5". Only
   two minor known bugs remain: Scrollback sometimes miscalculates the
   current row after a lot of scrolling back and forth (which is always
  "fixable" to pressing any-key which correctly rebuilds the current output
   page, and a display anomaly on the frontpage of "vampire.z8" which I
   intended to keep after a lot of code-inspection (since fizmo appears to
   be implementing the screen modell correctly and fixing this display
   problem breaks a lot of other games). This version has been tested on
   Linux, Darwin (Mac Os X) and a little bit on XP/Cygwin (using a self-built
   ncursesw).
 - Fixed timed-input detection for "read" opcode. This fixes the crash in
   ZTUU when the lantern goes out.
 - Ran fizmo through (sp)lint, fixed memory leaks, minor bugs, many typecasts,
   some double and inconsistent definitions, cleanup up code.
 - Fixed Makefile dependencies.
 - Implemened scrollback for ncursesw interface, added support method for
   scrollback in "history.c".
 - Added configuration system.
 - Some split-window / set_window / set_cursor fixed for ncursesw-interface.
 - Substitued ualarm/signal with setitimer/sigaction since the first one
   won't catch SIGALRM on linux and manpage says that ualarm is obsolete.
 - Fixed color management so that ncurses color pair is avaiable for reading.
 - Many, many minor bugfixes.

   Version 0.4.1
 + 0.4.1 was finished at about Wed Nov 14 08:23:19 CET 2007.
 - Separated code in core, interface, c and cpp interfaces.
 - Improved upper window handling (trinity sundial) and blockbuffer (zork1.z5).
